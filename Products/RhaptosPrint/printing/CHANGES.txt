  - fix various problems with numbering (e.g. exclude definition//example 
    from numbering);
  - fix more LaTeX escaping problems;

printing-2.1.1
  - Remove -e switch from imagefix for...some reason related to performance.

printing-2.1
  - fix a spurious right curly brace that was causing a problem in some tables

printing-2.0
  - Handle tables that are too long to display on one page.
  - Adapt printing system to handle module PDF generation as well as 
    collection PDF generation.
  - Still more refinements to automatic image sizing.
  - Add four new display parameters for collections:
    - paper size (8.5"x11" vs. 6"x9");
    - font face (Computer Modern vs. Times vs. Palatino);
    - font size (10pt vs. 12pt);
    - paragraph spacing (compact vs. loose).
  - Add partial support for author-selected math display parameters 
    in collections.
  - Miscellaneous fixes to LaTeX output.

printing-1.5
  - Further improvements to automatic image sizing, including:
    - don't make images too small in many cases;
    - take subfigure layout into account in resizing.
  - Footnote in tables numbering problem fixed.
  - Extra vertical rules no longer appear in table headers and 
    footers.
  - Display problem in bibliographies fixed.
  - Display of inline code fixed.
  - Don't display graphics from outside the Connexions repository 
    in PDFs; insert a message with the URI for the graphic file 
    instead.
  - When lists occur within indented environments such as example, 
    increase their margins so that the nesting is apparent.
  - Added tools:
    - stylesheet that consumes a .tmp1 collection XML file and 
      outputs it with only tables as its content.
    - stylesheet that consumes a simple XML file listing modules 
      and their versions and that creates a collection RDF file 
      for a collection containing those modules (e.g. to create 
      extra-repository test collections).

printing-1.4
  - First production release of collection printing code.
  - Complete reworking of CALS table handling, to support resizing 
    tables for width problems.  For a list of CALS table features not 
    yet supported, see TODO.txt.
  - imagefix changes:
    - imagefix now resizes images automatically that it decides may 
      be too large for the PDF;
    - script moved from svn 'scripts' directory to 'printing';
  - Conditional typesetting of block math to prevent math from 
    running off the edge of the page.
  - Complete re-working of cnxn reference handling.
  - Implement rules for determining whether a module is front matter, 
    a chapter or a section.
  - Implement rules for computing attribution on title page.
  - Add an "Attributions" section at the back of the PDF, listing the 
    collection and each module (including license and lineage) and 
    its authors.
  - Retry retrievals of content and referenced modules.
  - Navigational improvements:
    - exercises and their solutions have page number references to 
      each other;
    - module beginnings have footnotes indicating where to find the 
      online version of the content.
  - Fixes for many orphan problems.
  - replace.py (character replacement and escaping) script moved into 
    'printing'.
  - zopectl script for uploading PDFs to repository;
  - Improvements to makefile, including 'clean' and 'clear' targets, 
    and a target to retrieve the collection RDF description.
  - Added conditional debug info that gets written to pdflatex log 
    and into collection PDF, to ease testing of changes.
  - Miscellaneous changes in LaTeX output to eliminate some syntax errors.

printing-1.3
  - Strip base 10 subscripts incorrectly added by xsltproc from DTD 
    default attributes when document is built.
  - in latex/cnxml.xsl, get value of Cnx URI from 'course/@uri' 
    instead of hard-coding it in the stylesheet
  - Moved 'solution' elements to their own sections at the end of 
    chapters with correct numbering of figures and references to exercises
  - Added parameters for 6" x 9" page format (commented out, but available)
  - Added 'solutions' element to courses to contain solutions at end of chapter

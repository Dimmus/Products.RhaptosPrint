  <md:abstract>Java Digital Signal Processing (J-DSP) is an object-oriented visual programming tool that enables users to establish and run online signal processing simulations, and visualize Internet based interactive demos. It has been used in laboratories involving both on campus and distance learning students and has been evaluated thoroughly through educational assessment. Although J-DSP has been successful in class use as an individual DSP tool, much like other DSP simulation programs it lacked the capability to accommodate student teams performing jointly laboratories and simulations.
Recently new J-DSP software capability that supports collaborative simulations has been developed. This new and unique J-DSP “blackboard” concept accommodates students working on DSP labs from different locations. Students working from separate locations program the J-DSP blocks jointly while viewing and running common tasks. This new capability is also supported by a recently developed J-DSP chat that helps the students coordinate their lab activities and work as a team much like they do in a lab. The new facility is accomplished by J-DSP scripts that are transmitted through a server-client network. Sample exercises and assessment instruments have also been developed to evaluate the program. Technical network-related delay issues and their impact on this new facility have been examined by performing joint J-DSP experiments with U.S. and international institutions. Assessments were also carried in class with ASU students taking the DSP course.</md:abstract>

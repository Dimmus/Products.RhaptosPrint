This package generates PDFs from complete zips of collections or zips of modules
by converting the collxml and cnxml to docbook and then using Apache's FOP.

Technologies used:
 * Connexions  : http://cnx.org
 * Docbook XSL : http://docbook.org
 * Docbook RNG : http://docbook.org/rng
 * Apache FOP  : http://xmlgraphics.apache.org
 * xsltproc    : http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT
 * Saxon 9     : http://saxon.sourceforge.net
 * pmml2svg    : http://pmml2svg.sourceforge.net
 * Jing        : http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang
 * STIX Fonts  : http://stixfonts.org

The following files may be useful:
 * docbook.txt : Instructions on how to configure and run the docbook PDF generation
 * epub.txt    : Instructions on generating an epub from a collection or module
 * design.txt  : Notes on the entire PDF generation process
 * output.txt  : Notes on the output from different stages of conversion
 * notes.txt   : My personal scratchpad

Also, we had a version of the PDF that renders figures and notes in the margin. 
The code only moves marginalia to the left but with an additional XSLT pass on the intermediate XML generated by FOP (an abstract tree), these could be moved to the right on even-numbered pages.
This should be the last revision that contains the margin-specific code so doing a SVN annotate on this file should provide the necessary revision information.

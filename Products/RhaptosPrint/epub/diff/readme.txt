For all the tests you'd like to be able to diff before committing be sure to run this right after checking out this code.
That way you have a control group (what the files looked like before making changes).

Then, make some changes and re-run the tests on each (checking what the report HTML file looks like to see diffs)


Also, be sure to check out https://github.com/philschatz/oer.epubcss into the current directory (so oer is in this dir).

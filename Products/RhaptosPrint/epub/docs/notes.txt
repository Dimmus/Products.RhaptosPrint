Prints unmatched links, images that are too big



Running the xslt:


Run the java class.
declare -x COL_PATH=col10522_1.36_complete
time xsltproc --xinclude xsl/docbook-cleanup-whole.xsl $COL_PATH/collection.dbk > $COL_PATH/collection-whole.cleaned.dbk

time xsltproc xsl/postprocess-svg.xsl $COL_PATH/collection-whole.dbk.fo.xml > $COL_PATH/collection-whole.dbk.aligned.fo.xml

# From the collection dir (to get the images to attach)

To search modules for a specific xpath expression use the following:
COL_PATH=~/Downloads/all-modules; for MODULE in `ls $COL_PATH`; do if [ -d $COL_PATH/$MODULE ]; then bash scripts/module-xpath.sh "c:para[count(c:definition)>1]" $COL_PATH $MODULE "<definition"; fi; done
COL_PATH=~/Downloads/all-modules; for MODULE in `ls $COL_PATH`; do if [ -d $COL_PATH/$MODULE ]; then bash scripts/module-xpath.sh "c:para[c:newline]" $COL_PATH $MODULE "newline"; fi; done

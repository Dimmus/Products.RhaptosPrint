There is an alpha tool that runs over a module or collection cnxml (well, actually DBK file) and
prints out all the links to other documents, resources, paras, modules, URLs including broken ones.

To run this, you'll need to run scripts/debug-linkchecker.sh with the path to a dbk file.

Additionally, if yu want it to print out the xpath to the offending c:link tag, you'll have to
run ./scripts/collection2dbk.sh with an additional last argument 
(for example "-debug", but as long as it's non-empty, it'll work) 
to annotate the dbk file with an xpath to the original cnxml.

If you're just interested in a module, you can run scripts/module2dbk.sh with an additional argument.

Then, an XML report spits out.
If you want to use it from python, you can use xml2json.xsl (found in CNXMLTransform) to convert it to
something more pythonic (use demjson to make python dictionaries and arrays)

And voila! a link-checking tool!

Faulty PDF Conversion:
 * Make author/title page
 * Remove duplicate glossary items
 * Scale images (using Python Imaging Library to get their size)
 * Add footnotes for links (make sure mp3 links in Music Theory work)
 * Allow multiple images in a figure
 * Move solutions to back of book instead of right after the problem
 * Resize SVG width (change height also to maintain aspect ratio)
 * Enable footnotes
 * Change table width in PDFs (need to do string-len counting fancy footwork to set the width)
 * (low) Make figures have a line above and below the figure and make them less wide so the figure is clear.
 * (low) Move figure text up with the figure title for clarity
 * (low) Change "[115]" to "(pg 115)" 


For Regression:
 * Run PDF gen on all modules, logging which fail.
 * Convert PDF to text.
 * Compare PDF with LaTeX method (word frequency diff or diff using 1 word per line).

After generating epub files for all the collections, I got the following bugs (need to implement):
(the 1st column is the number of occurrences and the next column )
$ grep "^LOG:" epub-convert.txt | grep -v "MathML Not converted" | grep -v "xincluded" | sort | uniq -c | sort -r
